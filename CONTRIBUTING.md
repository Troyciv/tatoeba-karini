### As a user

If you want to help but don't know where start, just let your feedback.

**[Open an issue](https://github.com/lsrdg/tatoeba-karini/issues/new)**. 
On it, you can mention:

- your operating system
- how was to set it up
- which functionality you needed/used (why?)
- which functionality you don't need/used (and why?)
- whether or not you will keep using it (and why?)

Any feedback is a good feedback and it will be appreciated. (:

### As a developer

The code is short enough to not need any kind of strictness, just go for it if
you feel like. However, the code is pretty much a very *work in progress* and is
being improved, but quality can't be assured. Feel free to open an issue with
questions, critiques etc.

You might want to take a look at the
[milestones](https://github.com/lsrdg/tatoeba-karini/milestones) of the project.

Just assign to yourself an issue, or create one in case it doesn't exist. o/
